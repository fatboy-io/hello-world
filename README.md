# hello-world!

My name is Jared and I am an auto detailer who is making the transition to work in the IT Field.
I like tacos, cars and computers. On my spare time I like to research about cryptocurrency and learn about new changes in the tech field.
I have built and set up a handful of computers and am comfortable with handling basic technical troubleshooting.
I will be attending a university in order to acheive my goals and work my way towards a great career path in cyber security.
This platform will display my progress towards my goals.

Thanks for stopping by!
